# Funnycoin - A decentralized image archive

## A decentralized ledger of funny images, anybody can submit their images.


### Funnycoin has two categories of miners, One that does optimized calculations to calculate wether the wallet has enough balance and that the blockchain is valid. The other miner category is the ones that rate the images, anybody can join this position.

**## How do funnycoins get added to circulation?**

### Funnycoins are added into circulation by a coinbase adding them with consensus with majority of the network. The image rating miners split the funnycoins with the user that submitted the image. Traditional miners doing calculations split rewards with the image submitter, as the "owner" of a block.

## How do images get accepted

### Images get accepted by either: A majority of the image raters giving it a positive review (determined by block difficulty) or a large minority of the image raters giving a high rating determined by block difficulty and the network rating average.

## TODO:

### create voting system, create website to view archived images, create option to delete a photo from the archive, allowing photos that slipped through the cracks to be removed.
